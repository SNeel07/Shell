#SHELL/TERMINAL

<p>This project is a basic version of building our own shell from scratch. It doesn't include any fancy features/extensions in it.</p>
<p>Rather I just learned C and decided to make this project as to implement what I learnt.</p>
<br>
<p>Previously, I had included the sys/wait.h which is a POSIX compatible and wouldn't run on windows. Later I used AI to change it
and made it windows compatible (bcoz I didn't know how to do it .....)</p>
<br>
<p>The code and tutorial is provided in the Src folder.</p>
<p>So, just copy the main.c in your code editor, compile it and you'll see the .exe file. Run that .exe file</p>
